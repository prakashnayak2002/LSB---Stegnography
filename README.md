Description :

This project implements Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography using the C programming language, allowing secure hiding and extraction of secret text messages inside BMP image files without noticeable visual changes.

Objective :

To demonstrate how data can be hidden inside digital images using bit-level manipulation while maintaining image integrity.

Technologies Used :

C Programming Language

File Handling

Bitwise Operations

BMP Image Format

Features :

Hide secret text inside a BMP image

Extract hidden text from a stego image

Minimal image distortion

Simple command-line interface

Efficient and lightweight implementation
